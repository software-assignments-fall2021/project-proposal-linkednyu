# Project Proposal
## Core Idea: 
LinkedNYU

## Team members: 
Anastasia Ye, Willis Ma, Tianshu Wang

## What is it?
A social media platform for NYU students exclusive. Where students from the same course can easily find each other, chat, share notes and socialize. 

## Why and for whom?
NYU currently doesnâ€™t provide a specific platform for students from the same course to chat with each other. Some classes use discord, slack or group me, but usually cannot include every one. Besides, without a campus, it is hard for NYU students to socialize with their classmates. 
LinkedNYU provides a platform for students from the same course to find their classmates, share notes with each other and socialize. Previous students from this course can share their experience and help others decide whether to take this course or not. 

## How?
In order to provide most convenient and satisfying experience for NYU students, LinkedNYU is supposed to contain following basic functions:
	Searching:
Powerful searching tools that will enable students to find their courses based on the course number, name, name of Professor;
Plugin filter for students to narrow down the results and further help students find the right course.
Will show courses' status as open, waitlist, or closed.
Sharing:
Each course section only opens to students who are taking, or have taken the course before. 
Each course will have its own exclusive forum for students to communicate. 
Each course will have its own resource folder, which will collect notes and other resources from volunteer students who have taken the same course before.
Statistics:
Courses' historical data will be available to students, which will include average grades, professor rating, workload, etc. All students can voluntarily contribute to this part. 

## Scope
Since this app is likely to be structured with three to four different sections, we may need 5-6 members to develop it.
For the front-end, we need a UI for searching, chatting and displaying data.
For the back-end, we need a database to store user information, course information and chat history. We also need to analyze statistics of each course.
